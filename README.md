Describtion:

Project: Story-Telling App

A design prototype crafted in Figma for a mobile/web app focused on storytelling. The app is aimed at helping users create, share, and consume stories in an immersive, engaging way. It’s designed to deliver a seamless, emotionally rich experience through narrative content, with attention to visual design, interaction, and user flow.

Key Features / Components

Story Feed / Discovery
Users can explore a curated feed of stories — text, images, possibly mixed media — with previews, thumbnails or summaries to help them pick what to read.

Story Creation / Editor
An interface for authors to write or assemble their stories: text input, formatting, embedding images or media, possibly options for layouts or templates.

Reading Mode
Designed for immersive reading: clean typography, good spacing, minimal distractions (e.g. hiding navigation during reading), maybe night mode or adjustable text size.

User Profiles & Social Interaction
Profiles for authors and readers: followers, likes, bookmarks, comments. They might allow users to share their own stories, see others’ works, interact or give feedback.

Story Detail View
When selecting a story: full content view, author info, metadata (date, length, tags), comments, sharing.

Onboarding / Welcome Flow
First-time user flows: onboarding screens explaining features, choosing interests, setting preferences so the feed can be personalized.

Settings / Preferences
Where users can adjust reading settings (font size, themes), notifications, account settings, maybe manage saved/bookmarked stories.

Visual / UI Style

Clean, readable typography with good contrast to improve readability.

Use of imagery or visuals to enhance stories (cover images, illustration, possibly hero images).

Consistent colour scheme and iconography to support a calm, focused reading experience.

Layouts that balance text and visuals, with good spacing.

Goals & Purpose

To create an engaging storytelling experience that puts the story first (i.e. focus on readability, immersion).

To enable both creators (writers) and consumers (readers) to connect: discover new stories, share feedback, have a community element.

To showcase interaction design and UX for narrative content — how to make reading, writing, browsing stories feel smooth and visually appealing.
